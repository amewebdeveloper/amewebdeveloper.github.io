                    <!--<p>There is something unique about the beautiful sound of the string section in an orchestra. When it comes
                to music that really "pulls on your heart strings," no music score is complete without the presence of one of
                the four major string instruments:</p>
                <p align="center">violin</p>
                <p align="center">viola</p>
                <p align="center">cello</p>
                <p align="center">bass</p>
                <p>The opportunity has arrived for you to foster a love for music in yourself or your child. You can also play a
                part of growing a community of young musicians in your own neighborhood by sponsoring a student for a season. If so, <!--might have to fix "If so"; that doens't make sense-->

                    <div id="textHolder">
                        <p>Maidellyn Easey has a love for the Lord which she displays in her desire to serve Him by lifting up His name through music. Born 
                        in Cuba and raised in Florida, her musical influence came primarily from her father, Harold Stout, who at one time was the principal 
                        violist in the Cuban Philharmonic Orchestra. He was Maidellyn's first violin instructor and the one who led her to realize that the 
                        purpose of the instrument would always be to praise the Lord. For several years, all of Maidellyn's family (parents and three sisters) 
                        performed sacred concerts throughout  states, debuting several of her own compositions. Maidellyn went on to study music with private 
                        teachers and professors and received her Bachelor's and Master's in Music Performance at the University of South Florida. </p>

                            <img src="images/maidellynAgainstTree.JPG" id="maidellynImage" alt="Maidellyn Easey with her violin." />
                        </div>
                        <p>Before beginning the journey of a fulltime mother and homeschool teacher, she played semi-professionally in local orchestras and chamber 
                        groups. She also formed a string ensemble, conducted a youth choir, and bell choir, at Tampa Adventist Academy, as well as provide private 
                        lessons in voice, violin and piano, at Tampa Music Academy. </p>
                        <p>She began to train her sons, Azariah and Jeremiah, on musical instruments when they were 5 years old and opened up her services to the children 
                        in the community, which resulted in the birth of a small musical ensemble that allowed young people to explore and develop their musical skills.</p>
                        <p>Maidellyn has a passion for music and young people and takes great joy in seeing those two combined. It is her continuous desire that 
                        her talents may be used for the glory of God, and for the blessing of the community.</p>
