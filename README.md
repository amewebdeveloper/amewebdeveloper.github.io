# About This Repository.
This repository hosts the code that is the backbone (or, should I say, frontbone) of the website for Easey Strings, a 
Kansas-based music studio dedicated to teach children how to play the violin, cello, viola, and bass. 
The site uses GitHub Pages as its host and operates as easeystrings.com.
